# Exploring C Programming: From Cryptography to Data Structures
This immersive exploration of the C programming language encompasses three distinct projects, each designed to deepen students' understanding and proficiency in various programming concepts. The first project delves into cryptography, focusing on building an encryption and decryption system using C. Students gain insights into cryptographic principles and algorithms, such as Caesar Cipher and Advanced Encryption Standard (AES), while refining their skills in data security and encryption techniques. The second project delves into linked lists and arrays, guiding students through the implementation and manipulation of both data structures. Through this project, students develop a solid understanding of pointers, memory management, and dynamic data structures like linked lists, while also mastering array-based operations such as sorting and searching. Finally, the third project focuses on trees, introducing students to fundamental concepts such as binary trees, binary search trees, and tree traversal algorithms. By exploring these diverse topics, students enhance their problem-solving abilities, algorithmic thinking, and overall proficiency in C programming, empowering them to tackle a wide range of programming challenges with confidence and competence.
